                question: "A scientist is studying genetic exchange in eukaryotes. She observes a process that involves the physical exchange of DNA between two homologous chromosomes, requiring a large region of sequence similarity (>= 50-100 bp). This process is crucial for chromosome segregation during meiosis. Which type of recombination is being observed?",
                options: { 
                    A: "Homologous genetic recombination", 
                    B: "Illegitimate recombination (NHEJ)", 
                    C: "Transpositional recombination", 
                    D: "Conservative site-specific recombination" 
                },
                correctAnswer: "A",
                rationale: "Homologous recombination is defined by the exchange of genetic material between two DNA molecules that share a large region of sequence similarity. It is a fundamental process in eukaryotes for repairing double-strand breaks and for ensuring proper chromosome pairing and segregation during meiosis.",
                source: "'Recombination between two homologous DNA molecules. Requires relatively large (≥ 50-100 bp) regions of sequence similarity... and pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis in eukaryotes.' (DNA Recombination, Page 6)"

                learningObjective: "LO 1 (DNA Recombination): Define recombination, the significance of recombination in living organisms, and describe the four major recombination types.",
                question: "A cell culture is exposed to a chemical that causes numerous double-strand DNA breaks. The cell's repair machinery ligates the broken ends directly together, often resulting in small insertions or deletions at the break site. This process does not use a homologous template for repair. Which type of recombination is this?",
                options: { 
                    A: "Homologous recombination", 
                    B: "Transpositional recombination", 
                    C: "Conservative site-specific recombination", 
                    D: "Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)" 
                },
                correctAnswer: "D",
                rationale: "Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), also called illegitimate recombination, is a major pathway for repairing double-strand breaks. It is characterized by the direct ligation of broken DNA ends without the need for a homologous template. This process is often error-prone and can lead to small mutations at the repair site.",
                source: "'Non-homologous end joining (illegitimate recombination)... Break ends are directly ligated without need for template; microhomologies with just one or two base complementarity is used to join the ends.' (DNA Recombination, Pages 5 & 20)"

                learningObjective: "LO 1 (DNA Recombination): Define recombination, the significance of recombination in living organisms, and describe the four major recombination types.",
                question: "Which of the following is a primary significance of recombination in living organisms, contributing to long-term evolutionary change?",
                options: { 
                    A: "It ensures that daughter cells are genetically identical to the parent cell.", 
                    B: "It prevents any changes in the genomic DNA sequence.", 
                    C: "It provides genetic variation by allowing for the exchange and reassortment of genes.", 
                    D: "It exclusively repairs single-strand DNA breaks." 
                },
                correctAnswer: "C",
                rationale: "Recombination is a key driver of genetic diversity. By shuffling alleles between homologous chromosomes during meiosis (reassortment of genes), it creates new combinations of genes in the offspring. This genetic variation is the raw material upon which natural selection acts, allowing populations to adapt and evolve.",
                source: "'Provides genetic variation by allowing for genetic exchange and reassortment of genes along chromosomes.' (DNA Recombination, Page 4)"

                question: "A patient with severe hemophilia A is found to have a large inversion mutation that disrupts the coagulation factor VIII gene. This type of chromosomal rearrangement is often caused by aberrant homologous recombination between which of the following genomic features?",
                options: {

                },
                correctAnswer: "C",
                rationale: "Aberrant or ectopic recombination occurs when homologous recombination happens between repetitive DNA sequences (like LINEs or SINEs) that are not in their correct allelic positions. If this occurs between two inverted repeats on the same chromosome, the intervening segment of DNA will be flipped, resulting in an inversion that can disrupt gene function.",
                source: "'Errors during homologous recombination (ectopic recombination) cause chromosomal abnormalities and these errors are primarily due to presence of repetitive DNA sequence.' The accompanying diagram shows inverted repeats leading to an inversion. (DNA Recombination, Page 15)"

                learningObjective: "LO 2 (DNA Recombination): Discuss the molecular events in homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining...",
                question: "During meiosis in a healthy human male, a specific protein is expressed that intentionally creates double-strand breaks in the DNA. This process is essential for initiating homologous recombination and ensuring proper pairing of homologous chromosomes. Which protein is responsible for creating these initial breaks?",
                options: { 
                    A: "RecA", 
                    B: "BRCA1", 
                    C: "DNA Ligase", 
                    D: "Spo11" 
                },
                correctAnswer: "D",
                rationale: "Spo11 is a specialized enzyme expressed specifically during meiotic prophase. Its function is to introduce programmed double-strand breaks into the DNA. These breaks are the initiating event for homologous recombination, which is required for the synapsis and segregation of homologous chromosomes.",
                source: "'A specific protein, Spo11, is expressed during prophase of meiosis which introduces double-strand breaks to initiate recombination.' (DNA Recombination, Page 13)"

                question: "The repair of a double-strand break by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) can sometimes lead to cancer-causing mutations. A translocation that places a proto-oncogene under the control of a strong, constitutively active promoter from another gene is an example of such a mutation. This type of event is a result of NHEJ repairing a break between which of the following?",
                options: { 
                    A: "Two sister chromatids", 
                    B: "Two homologous chromosomes", 
                    C: "Two non-homologous chromosomes", 
                    D: "The start and end of the same chromosome" 
                },
                correctAnswer: "C",
                rationale: "Translocations involve the exchange of genetic material between non-homologous chromosomes. If double-strand breaks occur on two different chromosomes, the NHEJ pathway may incorrectly join the broken ends from the different chromosomes. This can create fusion genes or place a proto-oncogene under inappropriate regulatory control, leading to its overexpression and contributing to cancer.",
                source: "The diagram on page 22 illustrates a gene rearrangement where a proto-oncogene is placed under the control of a strong promoter from another gene (Gene X), a classic example of translocation. (DNA Recombination, Page 22)"

This non-functional gene copy was most likely generated by which of the following mechanisms?",

                rationale: "Many viruses, including poliovirus, shut off host cell translation to commandeer the ribosomes for their own use. Poliovirus protease specifically cleaves eIF4G, a large scaffolding protein that is part of the eIF4F cap-binding complex. Cleavage of eIF4G prevents the ribosome from recognizing the 5' cap of host mRNAs. The viral mRNA is then translated via a cap-independent mechanism using an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES).",

It acts as a landing pad for the ribosome, allowing it to assemble directly at an internal location on the mRNA and initiate translation without first recognizing the 5' cap. This is a key strategy for viruses that shut down host cap-dependent translation.",

Phosphorylated eIF2-GDP binds very tightly to its guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, sequestering it and preventing it from recycling other eIF2 molecules back to their active, GTP-bound state.
